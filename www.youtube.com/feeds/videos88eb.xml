Hello internet friends, 
I spent the past few weeks writing a comedy song about the election.  I recorded it, I had a crew ready to shoot the video, a location, everything was in place…  And then, I got bummed.  REALLY bummed.  It didn’t feel right.  I felt like what I was doing was extremely judgmental, narrow-minded, and to be honest, pretty unoriginal.  So, a few days ago, I decided to pull the plug on the whole thing.  Five minutes later, I wrote this song.  It’s very simple, personal, and not funny AT ALL.  I hope some of you like it, I know it’s not going to be for everyone.  I promise there will be some inspired, consciousness-expanding, extremely original comedy to come in the near future. 
Thanks for your patience, 
Jon
p.s. I put it up on iTunes and the streaming sites so that it could be available to everyone, but it’s free on Soundcloud.  If I make any money off of this track, I promise I’ll give it away to charity.  Not sure why you’d trust me, but I promise.

Wolfie's Just Fine is me, Jon Lajoie making music that doesn't necessarily have any punchlines (at least not intentionally). I sincerely hope at least a few of you enjoy it. If you’re not digging this stuff, I totally get it. Fear not, there will be more comedy under the “Jon Lajoie” banner soon!

Wolfie's Just Fine is me, Jon Lajoie making music that doesn't necessarily have any punchlines (at least not intentionally). I sincerely hope at least a few of you enjoy it. I’m releasing this album independently (just like everything I’ve ever done), so I’m hoping it will find its audience through word of mouth.  And if you’re not digging this stuff, I totally get it. Fear not, there will be more comedy under the “Jon Lajoie” banner soon!

LYRICS:
Please use this song in your commercial
I need the money, so please use this to sell something
Please use this song in your commercial

A fast food franchise, office supplies,
A brand new hair dye, a dating website,
A suicide hotline, a new way to exercise, 
A preview for a movie that is coming out in July, 
A political campaign, a new video game, 
A medication that you didn't know you should be taking
Any product any service this is the right song, 
Your target audience will be singing and dancing along

Please use this song in your commercial
I need the exposure, my house is in foreclosure
So please use this song in your commercial

Oh to have a song in a national campaign
Millions would hear my song and they would say
&quot;Have you seen that commercial?  
You know the one about that thing?  
The song playing in the background is really great!&quot;

A credit card company, join the military, 
A new way to make yourself less hairy, 
Life insurance, medical insurance, 
Cat insurance, insurance insurance, 
Financial institution, the one that took my house, 
If you use this song maybe we can work something out
Any product any service this is the right song, 
Your target audience will be singing and dancing along

Please use this song in your commercial 
The music industry's dying, but consumerism is thriving
So please use this song in your commercial</media:description>

LYRICS:
You're the dude from high school I see at the gym
You're a friend of a friend or a second cousin
You're a coworker I sometimes eat lunch with
You're one of my many acquaintances
You know Christmas is about spending time
With friends and family
but just because you're not in one of those
two categories
Doesn't mean that I won't still do something special for you
Because Christmas is about giving, so here's what I'll do

I'm gonna send you a Christmas text (Christmas text, Christmas text)
Gonna type Merry Christmas exclamation point and then press send

Maybe I'll just copy and paste it (from a previous text)
Well, it's only two words I might as well just type it (less complicated)
If you're thinking of calling me to thank me, oh please don't (that's not how this works)
Texting is as far as this relationship goes (and keep your response brief)
I have way more important people in my life
You're not even in the top fifty
It's not that I don't care about you...
Well, yeah, I don't really care about you
But doesn't mean that I won't still do something special for you
Because Christmas is about giving, so here's what I'll do

I'm gonna send you a Christmas text (Christmas text, Christmas text)
Gonna type Merry Christmas exclamation point and then press send

I don't care enough to call
but I don't &quot;not care&quot; enough to do nothing

And to all of my non-Christian friends I will text you...
&quot;Hey dude, what's going on?  We should tots hang next week&quot;</media:description>

   <media:description>A quick song I wrote for Miley Cyrus.  www.JonLajoie.com 

Lyrics:

We want topless women in our music videos
We want pop stars acting like they're in a porno
You know we want it and we gettin' what we ask for
But when Miley does it we say &quot;Oh my God No!!&quot;

Why's she acting like a ho, this is so wrong, we all object
Where did she get the idea to act like a sexual object?
I suspect she is on drugs, I think she's losing her mind
Did you see her shaking her ass on TV, singing &quot;Blurred Lines&quot;
Which is such a wholesome song, I can't believe she ruined it
Her slutty moves made Robin Thicke look misogynistic
What a bitch, she makes me sick, doesn't she have ethics?  
How dare she try to use sex to sell pop music!

We want topless women in our music videos
We want pop stars acting like they're in a porno
We want it and we always get what we ask for
But when Miley does it we say &quot;Oh my God No!!&quot;

The line's no longer blurred you crossed it and upset the nation
Don't get us wrong, we're super cool with objectification 
But it's hard to watch you play that part, we've know you for too long
So please go back to singing the Hannah Montana theme song
And we'll go back to watching others do exactly what you did
And we won't be offended cause we can not picture them as kids
And we'll be cool with videos with women prancing around naked
And it won't be sexist as long as the song's a number 1 hit 

We want topless women in our music videos 
We want pop stars acting like they're in a porno 
We want it and we gettin' what we ask for
But when Miley does it we say &quot;Oh my God No!!&quot; 

Miley, oh Miley. 
You're upsetting everybody
By being so slutty, 
Unlike all the other pop stars....</media:description>

   <media:description>A quick song I wrote in support of the students who are striking all across Quebec.  
Join the march on May 22nd at Place des Festivals in Montreal.  Democracy is not
negotiable.  Also, I am aware that this is not a comedy song, don't worry, there's more comedy to come soon.</media:description>
