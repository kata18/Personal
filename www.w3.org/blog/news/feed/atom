<p>The Indexed Database API 2.0 specification defines APIs for a database of records holding simple values and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key and some value. Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records it stores. An application developer directly uses an API to locate records either by their key or by using an index. A query language can be layered on this API. An indexed database can be implemented using a persistent B-tree data structure.</p>

<p>ActivityPub is a decentralized social networking protocol based upon the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core">ActivityStreams</a> 2.0 data format. It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering notifications and content.</p>
<p>ActivityPub is already <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/">implemented and deployed</a> to a number of projects and a wide userbase, including over <a href="https://mnm.social/">1 million registered users</a> across thousands of Mastodon instances. ActivityPub allows software projects both small and large to build social network offerings into their systems. Adding ActivityPub support allows interoperable social networking between applications with entirely different codebases. For example, <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube">PeerTube</a> users are able to use ActivityPub to <a href="https://peertube.cpy.re/videos/watch/da2b08d4-a242-4170-b32a-4ec8cbdca701">allow users to share videos and comment</a> across different servers.</p>

<p>Sponsored by Beihang University, this edition is a redesign of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/08/mobile-web-app-state/">Standards for Web Applications on Mobile: current state and roadmap</a> document, published on a quarterly basis from 2011 to 2015. It documents existing standards, highlights ongoing standardization efforts, points out topics under incubation, and discusses technical gaps that may need to be addressed in the future. For instance, the document identifies ongoing work around Progressive Web Applications that allow to create a consistent and persistent lifecycle for applications on the Web platform.</p>
<p>New versions will be published on a quarterly basis, or as needed depending on progress of key technologies of the Web platform. The document is part of a set of roadmaps under development in a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-roadmaps/">GitHub repository</a>, such as the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/web-roadmaps/media/">Overview of Media Technologies on the Web</a>. These roadmaps aim to provide a short-to-mid term view of where the Web Platform is heading in different areas. We encourage the community to review them and raise comments, or suggest new ones, on the repository&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-roadmaps/issues/">issue tracker</a>.</p>
